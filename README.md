# arm-to-track

Four robotic arms coordinate to keep a toy train moving in a circular path:  
- ** Arm 1 (UR3) ** 
- ** Arm 2, 3, 4 (Self-chosen robots) **
- Arm 1 sits in the middle and pushes the train in a circle
- Arms 2, 3, 4 sit in a triangle outside the circle track and move the track pieces in their region

Built with [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/roboticstoolbox-python) and Swift visualizer.
